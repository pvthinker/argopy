# argopy
Python tools to perform statistics with [Argo data](http://www.argo.ucsd.edu/) and produce global atlases of statistics. The tools allow to brew the over two millions of profiles in the Argo database with hundreds of cores. 

The resulting atlas has been published on SEANOE here: [https://doi.org/10.17882/72432](https://doi.org/10.17882/72432)
